    - Create a virtual environment and activate it:
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    - Install the required dependencies:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    - Create a `.env` file and configure the following constants:
        ```plaintext
        MONGODB_USERNAME=<your-mongodb-username>
        MONGODB_PASSWORD=<your-mongodb-password>
        MONGODB_DB_NAME=<your-database-name>
        APP_SECRET=<your-app-secret>
        SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=<your-spotify-client-id>
        SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=<your-spotify-client-secret>
        OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-openai-api-key>
        TOKEN_SECRET=<your-jwt-token-secret>
        ```

3. Set up the frontend:
    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
        ```bash
        cd ../frontend
        ```
    - Install dependencies:
        ```bash
        npm install
        ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory and configure the following constants:

        SERVER_URL=http://localhost:4000
        ```

### Running the Application

1. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    cd backend
    source venv/bin/activate # Activate the virtual environment if not already active
    bash start.sh
    ```

2. Start the frontend:
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm start
    ```

3. Access the application:
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, here are some common solutions:

1. **Backend not starting:**
    - Ensure the `.env` file in the `backend` directory is correctly configured with all the required constants.
    - Check that your MongoDB instance is running and accessible.

2. **Frontend not starting:**
    - Ensure the `.env` file in the `frontend` directory is correctly configured.

3. **Spotify API errors:**
    - Double-check your `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` in the backend `.env` file.
    - Ensure the redirect URI in your Spotify Developer Dashboard matches `http://localhost:4000/callback`.

4. **Environment-specific issues:**
    - On Windows, if `source venv/bin/activate` doesn't work, use `venv\Scripts\activate`.
    - For missing Python packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` again.

5. **Unexpected crashes:**
    - Run `npm install` again in both the backend and frontend directories to ensure all dependencies are installed.
    - Clear the `node_modules` directory and reinstall dependencies:
        ```bash
        rm -rf node_modules
        npm install
        ```
